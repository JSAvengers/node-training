- const buffer = Buffer.alloc(8);
- console.log(buffer);

- const buffer2 = Buffer.allocUnsafe(8);
- console.log(buffer2);

- buffer2.fill();
- console.log(buffer2);

- const string = 'touch√©';
- const buffer3 = Buffer.from(string, 'ascii');

- console.log(string, string.toString(), string.length);
- console.log(buffer3, buffer3.toString(), string.length);

```
